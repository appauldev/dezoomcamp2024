# Terraform
This folder contains the corresponding Terraform files for creating the GCP resources
that will be used for the activities (e.g. follow-along activities and homework) for each week

For example, the `week2/homework` folder contains the Terraform files for setting up the GCP resources
that has been used for the solutions of week 2 homework.

The decision to separate the Terraform files from their corresponding homework solution is mainly for convenience
since I would have an easier way of referencing my Terraform GCP Service Account key in this setup.

**I welcome suggestions regarding this folder setup! ðŸ–¤**
